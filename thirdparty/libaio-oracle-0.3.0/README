 
	This is a library for accessing the new AIO system calls for the
Linux kernel.  This library is a thin, state-keeping wrapper.  It
attempts to conform to the Single Unix Specification of the aio_read,
aio_write, aio_error, aio_return, and aio_suspend functions.  It also
implements lio_listio and aio_reap for batch processing.
	This library requires a kernel patched with Ben LaHaise's
latest AIO code.  In addition, it requires the libaio library from
Red Hat.
	To build this library, run "make".  The resulting
build should create the library libaio-oracle.so as well as two
test programs.  The first program, lio_test, is used to test lio_listio
submission and aio_reap collection of requests.  The second test,
oratest, writes 1.8GB files with write(), aio_write(),
and lio_listio().  This is intended to cover the gamut of sync, aio,
and batched aio.
	This package contains extensive debugging code.  If the kernel
supports it, it will query the file /proc/debug/aio.  This is initially
zero, but can be set to the values 1 (debug the library), 2 (debug the
kernel), or 3 (debug both).  If the kernel does not support
/proc/debug/aio, library debugging can still be turned on by setting the
initial value of debug_aio to 1 in the libaio-oracle.c file.
	Debugging output is placed in the directory /tmp/aio-$pid.
There is a trace file, and there are dump files for each I/O request.
	To use this library, all that is needed is the object file
libaio-oracle.so and the header libaio-oracle.h.
